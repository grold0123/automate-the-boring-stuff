        1.  programming language (with syntax rules for writing what is considered valid python code)
        2.  interpreter software that reads the source code and perform its instructions
    ENTERING EXPRESSIONS INTO THE INTERACTIVE SHELL
        >>> 2+2,    2+2 is an example of an expression, a kind of programming instruction in the language             
        4,          evaluate down to a single value
    INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING DATA TYPES
        integer values, whole numbers
        floating point numbers or floats, number with decimals
        string values, text values enclosed with quotes ''  / ""
    STRING CONCATENATION AND REPLICATION
        string concatenation, joining strings using + operator 
                >>>'alice' + 'box'
                alicebob
            -   the expression evaluates down to a single value
        string replication, using * operator to repeat a string by an int value 
            >>> 'alice'*5
            'alicealicealicealicealice'
    STORING VALUES IN VARIABLES 
        a box of computer memory, where you can store a single value

    FIRST PROGRAM 
        # .\python-exercises\first-program.py
    COMMENTS
        start a line using #
        python ignores comments 
        programmers use them to write notes / 
        used to remind yourself what the code is trying to do
    print() FUNCTION 
        display the string value inside its parentheses on the screen
            >>>print('Hello, world!')
            Hello, world!
    input() FUNCTION 
        waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER:
            >>>my_name = input('>')
            >gab
            >>>my_name 
            gab
    len() FUNCTION
        number of elements in a value
            example for a string value, 
                >>>name = 'gab'
                >>>len(name)
                3
            in a string value the number of character is evaluated
    THE str() , int() , float() FUNCTIONS
        str() , converts a value to its string equivalent
            >>>str(29)
            '29'
            >>>print('I am'+str()+ ' years old.' )
            I am 29 years old.
        int(), converts a value to its int equivalent 
            >>>int(1.12)
            1
        float(), converts a value to its float equivalent
            >>>float(1)
            1.0
    type() FUNCTION 
        pass a value to type() function will determine what type they are 
            >>> type(42)                                                                           
            <class 'int'>
            >>> type(42.0)
            <class 'float'>
            >>> type('forty two')
            <class 'str'>
            >>> name = 'zophie'
            >>> type(name)
            <class 'str'>
            >>> type(len(name))
            <class 'int'>
    round() FUNCTION 
        round() function, accepts a float and returns  the nearest integer 
            >>> round(3.14)
            3
            >>> round(7.7)
            8
            >>> round(-2.2)
            -2

            3.14
            >>> abs(0)
            0 
if-else and flow control    https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/chapter2.html
        1.  decide which python instructions to execute under which conditions
        2.  ability to skip, repeat, or choose one of several instructions to run
    BOOLEAN VALUES 
        has 2 values, True and False

    BOOLEAN OPERATORS
        all takes two values or expressions and evaluate to a single bool value 
            and , evaluates to True if both are True otherwise False   
                >>> True and True
                True
                >>> True and False
                False
            or , evaluates to True if at least one is True , False if both are False
            not , only takes one bool expression or value , evaluates to negative value 
    COMPONENTS OF FLOW CONTROL 
            condition, decides what to do based on its evaluated value 
            clause, followed by this block of code 
            example 
                username = 'mary'
                password = 'swordfish'
                if username == 'mary':              +--- condition
                    print('hello, mary')            +--- clause
                    if password == 'swordfish':             +---condition
                        print('access granted')             +---clause
                    else:                                   +---condition
                        print('wrong password.')            +---clause
        if 
                +most common type of flow control 
                +clause will execute if the statement's condition is True.
                +clause is skipped if codition is False
            +if this condition is true, execute the code in the clause 
            + 
                -   The if keyword 
                -   A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
                -   A colon 
                -   an indented block of code, called an if clause or if block 
            +example 
                name = 'alice'
                if name == 'alice':
                    print('Hi, Alice.')
        else
            + an else clause is executed only when the if statement's condition is False.
                + the else keyword
                + a colon 
                + indented block of code

                else:
                    print('Hello, stranger.')    
        elif 
            + if one of many possible clauses to execute 
            + provides another condition that is checked only 
                if all the previous conditions were False
